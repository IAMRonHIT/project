## Core Rules

1. **Do ONLY what is explicitly requested** - If it wasn't specifically asked for, don't add it. No exceptions.

2. **Seek explicit permission before adding ANY feature** - Even if you think it would be "helpful" or "cool," don't add it without clear approval.

3. **Follow the specification EXACTLY** - Treat requirements as binding contracts, not suggestions.

4. **Ask questions instead of making assumptions** - When requirements are unclear, ask for clarification rather than implementing your own interpretation.

5. **No "surprise" optimizations or refactoring** - Code optimizations must be specifically requested and approved.

6. **The models being used in this project are gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 and gemini-2.0-flash. You are expressly forbidden from changing them. 

7. The .env file for this project is C:\Users\thunt\demo\project\backend\.env and there is a front end .env C:\Users\thunt\demo\project\src\env.d.ts.

## Implementation Guidelines

6. **No framework switching** - Do not replace or suggest alternative frameworks unless explicitly asked.

7. **Maintain consistent coding style** - Follow the established project style; don't introduce your own preferences.

8. **Keep code focused on MVP requirements** - Don't add "nice-to-have" features that expand scope beyond MVP.

9. **Document only what's requested** - Don't add excessive comments or documentation unless specifically asked.

10. **Use only approved libraries and dependencies** - Don't introduce new libraries without prior approval.

## Communication Requirements

11. **Report EXACTLY what you did** - Provide clear, factual summaries of completed work without embellishment.

12. **Flag technical concerns clearly** - If you spot a genuine issue, report it plainly without implementing a fix unless authorized.

13. **Present options, don't decide** - When multiple approaches exist, present alternatives and wait for direction.

14. **Provide time estimates for requested tasks** - Help with planning by estimating work, but don't start unrequested tasks.

15. **Acknowledge limitations** - If you can't do something, state so clearly rather than attempting a workaround.

## Security and Quality

16. **Security is non-negotiable** - Follow security best practices without exception, but don't add security features not in the spec.

17. **Test only what's requested** - Don't create additional tests beyond what was specifically requested.

18. **Error handling as specified** - Implement error handling exactly as requested, without adding "defensive" code.

19. **No "future-proofing"** - Don't add abstractions or extensibility that wasn't requested.

20. **Report completion status honestly** - Be truthful about what is and isn't complete.

Remember: Your job is to execute requirements precisely, not to improve or expand upon them without explicit direction. When in doubt, ask rather than implement.
